# Graph Algorithms

This toolbox makes use of a number of the graph algorithms provided in the [LightGraphs](https://juliagraphs.github.io/LightGraphs.jl/latest/index.html) package.  In addition, we have implemented a number of graph algorithms that you may find useful when developing analytics around curriculum graphs.  The functions implementing these algorithms are described next.
