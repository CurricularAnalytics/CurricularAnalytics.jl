To compute the requisite distance, we sum this distance over all requisites.  That is, if write let <span>$T_j^p$</span> denote the term in degree plan <span>$p$</span> that course <span>$c_j$</span> appears in, then for a  degree plan with underlying curriculum graph <span>$G_c = (V,E)$</span>, the requisite distance for course <span>$c_j$</span> in degree plan <span>$p$</span>,  denoted <span>$rd_{v_j}^p$</span>, is:</p><div>\[rd_{v_j}^p = \sum_{\{i | (v_i, v_j) \in E\}} (T_j - T_i).\]</div><p>In general, it is desirable for a course and its requisites to appear as close together as possible in a degree plan. The requisite distance metric computed by this function is stored in the associated <code>Course</code> data object.</p></div><a class="docs-sourcelink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CurricularAnalytics/CurricularAnalytics.jl/blob/4581ad8ab1ff4693655355287028982808ed6213/src/DegreePlanAnalytics.jl#L78-L101">source</a></section><section><div><pre><code class="language-none">requisite_distance(plan::DegreePlan)</code></pre><p>For a given degree plan <code>plan</code>, this function computes the total distance between all courses in the degree plan, and  the requisites for those courses.  </p><p><strong>Arguments</strong></p><p>Required:</p><ul><li><code>plan::DegreePlan</code> : a valid degree plan (see <a href="types.html#Degree-Plans-1">Degree Plans</a>).   </li></ul><p>The distance between a course a requisite is given by the number of terms that separate the course from  its requisite in the degree plan.
