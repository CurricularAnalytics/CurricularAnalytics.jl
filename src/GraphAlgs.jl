# Depth-first search, returns edge classification using EdgeClass, as well as the discovery and finish time for each vertex.
"""
dfs(g)

Perform a depth-first traversal of input graph `g`.

# Arguments
Required:
- `g::AbstractGraph` : input graph.

This function returns the classification of each edge in graph `g`, as well as the order in which vertices are
first discovered during a depth-first search traversal, and when the processing from that vertex is completed
during the depth-first traverlsa.  According to the vertex discovery and finish times, each edge in `g` will be 
classified as one of:
 - *tree edge* : Any collection of edges in `g` that form a forest. Every vertex is either a single-vertex tree 
 with respect to such a collection, or is part of some larger tree through its connection to another vertex via a 
 tree edge. This collection is not unique defined on `g`.
 - *back edge* : Given a collection of tree edges, back edges are those edges that connect some descendent vertex 
 in a tree to an ancestor vertex in the same tree.
 - *forward edge* : Given a collection of tree edges, forward edges are those that are incident from an ancestor 
 in a tree, and incident to an descendent in the same tree.
 - *cross edge* : Given a collection of tree edges, cross edges are those that are adjacent between vertices in 
 two different trees, or between vertices in two different subtrees in the same tree.
