"""
The curriculum-based metrics in this toolbox are based upon the graph structure of a 
curriculum.  Specifically, assume curriculum ``c`` consists of ``n`` courses ``\\{c_1, \\ldots, c_n\\}``,
and that there are ``m`` requisite (prerequisite or co-requsitie) relationships between these courses.  
A curriculum graph ``G_c = (V,E)`` is formed by creating a vertex set ``V = \\{v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\}`` 
(i.e., one vertex for each course) along with an edge set ``E = \\{e_1, \\ldots, e_m\\}``, where a 
directed edge from vertex ``v_i`` to ``v_j`` is in ``E`` if course ``c_i`` is a requisite for course ``c_j``.

# Check if a curriculum graph has requisite cycles or extraneous requsities.
"""
    isvalid_curriculum(c::Curriculum, errors::IOBuffer)

Tests whether or not the curriculum graph ``G_c`` associated with curriculum `c` is valid.  Returns 
a boolean value, with `true` indicating the curriculum is valid, and `false` indicating it 
is not.

If ``G_c`` is not valid, the reason(s) why are written to the `errors` buffer. To view these 
reasons, use:

```julia-repl
julia> errors = IOBuffer()
julia> isvalid_curriculum(c, errors)
julia> println(String(take!(errors)))
```

There are two reasons why a curriculum graph might not be valid:
- Cycles : If a curriculum graph contains a directed cycle, it is not possible to complete the curriculum.
- Extraneous Requisites : These are redundant requisites that may introduce spurious complexity.
  If a curriculum has the prerequisite relationships \$c_1 \\rightarrow c_2 \\rightarrow c_3\$ 
  and \$c_1 \\rightarrow c_3\$, and \$c_1\$ and \$c_2\$ are *not* co-requisites, then \$c_1 
  \\rightarrow c_3\$ is redundant and therefore extraneous.

following conditions:
- ``v_i, v_j, v_k`` are distinct, i.e., ``v_i \\neq v_j, v_i \\neq v_k`` and ``v_j \\neq v_k``;
- there is a path from ``v_j`` to ``v_k`` that includes ``v_i``, i.e., ``v_j \\leadsto v_i \\leadsto v_k``;
- ``v_j`` has in-degree zero, i.e., ``v_j`` is a "source"; and

Let ``P_{v_i} = \\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots\\}`` denote the set of all directed paths that satisfy these
