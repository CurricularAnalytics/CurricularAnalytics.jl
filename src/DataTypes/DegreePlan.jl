    is_valid(plan::DegreePlan, errors::IOBuffer)

Tests whether or not the degree plan `plan` is valid.  Returns a boolean value, with `true` indicating the 
degree plan is valid, and `false` indicating it is not.

If `plan` is not valid, the reason(s) why are written to the `errors` buffer. To view these 
reasons, use:

```julia-repl
julia> errors = IOBuffer()
julia> is_valid(plan, errors)
julia> println(String(take!(errors)))
```

There are three reasons why a degree plan might not be valid:

- Requisites not satsified : A prerequisite for a course occurs in a later term than the course itself.
- Incomplete plan : There are course in the curriculum not included in the degree plan.
- Redundant plan : The same course appears in the degree plan multiple times.
