# Curriculum data type
# The required curriculum associated with a degree program
"""
The `Curriculum` data type is used to represent the collection of courses that must be
be completed in order to earn a particualr degree. Thus, we use the terms *curriculum* and
*degree program* synonymously. To instantiate a `Curriculum` use:

    Curriculum(name, courses; <keyword arguments>)

# Arguments
Required:
- `name::AbstractString` : the name of the curriculum.
- `courses::Array{Course}` : the collection of required courses that comprise the curriculum.
Keyword:
- `degree_type::AbstractString` : the type of degree, e.g. BA, BBA, BSc, BEng, etc.
- `institution:AbstractString` : the name of the institution offering the curriculum.
- `system_type::System` : the type of system the institution uses, allowable 
    types: `semester` (default), `quarter`.
- `CIP::AbstractString` : the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for the 
    curriculum.  See: `https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode`

# Examples:
```julia-repl
julia> Curriculum("Biology", courses, institution="South Harmon Tech", degree_type=AS, CIP="26.0101")
```

    is_valid(c::Curriculum, errors::IOBuffer)

Tests whether or not the curriculum graph ``G_c`` associated with curriculum `c` is valid, i.e.,
whether or not it contains a requisite cycle, or requisites that cannot be satisfied.  Returns  
a boolean value, with `true` indicating the curriculum is valid, and `false` indicating it is not.

If ``G_c`` is not valid, the `errors` buffer. To view these errors, use:

```julia-repl
julia> errors = IOBuffer()
julia> is_valid(c, errors)
julia> println(String(take!(errors)))
```

A curriculum graph is not valid if it contains a directed cycle or unsatisfiable requisites; in this 
case it is not possible to complete the curriculum. For the case of unsatisfiable requistes, consider
two courses ``c_1`` and ``c_2``, with ``c_1`` a prerequisite for ``c_2``. If a third course ``c_3`` 
is a strict corequisite for ``c_2``, as well as a requisite for ``c_1`` (or a requisite for any course 
on a path leading to ``c_2``), then the set of requisites cannot be satisfied.
