"""
The `AbstractCourse` data type is used to represent the notion of an abstract course that may appear in a curriculum 
or degree plan. That is, this abstract type serves as a placeholder for a course in a curriculum or degree plan,
where the abstract course may correspond to a single course, or a set of courses, where only one of the courses in the
set should be taken at that particular point in the curriculum or degree plan. This allows a user to specify a course
or a collection of courses as a part part of a curriculum or degree plans. The two possible concrete subtypes of 
an `AbstractCourse` are:
 - `Course` : a specific course.
 - `CourseCollection` : a set of courses, any of which can serve as the required course in a curriculum or degree plan.

# Course data type
"""
The `Course` data type is used to represent a single course consisting of a given number
of credit hours.  To instantiate a `Course` use:

    Course(name, credit_hours; <keyword arguments>)

# Arguments
Required:
- `name::AbstractString` : the name of the course.
- `credit_hours::int` : the number of credit hours associated with the course.
Keyword:
- `prefix::AbstractString` : the prefix associated with the course.
- `num::AbstractString` : the number associated with the course.
- `institution:AbstractString` : the name of the institution offering the course.
- `canonical_name::AbstractString` : the common name used for the course.

# Examples:
```julia-repl
julia> Course("Calculus with Applications", 4, prefix="MA", num="112", canonical_name="Calculus I")
```
