Using the curriculum `c` supplied as input, returns a degree plan optimzed according to the various 
optimization criteria that have been specified as well as the objective functions that have been selected.

If an optimzied plan cannot be constructed (i.e., the constraints are such that an optimal solution is infeasible),
`nothing` is returned, and the solver returns a message indicating that the problems is infeasible.  In these cases,
you may wish to experiment with the constraint values.

# Arguments
- `curric::Curriculum` : the curriculum the degree plan will be created from.
- `term_count::Int` : the maximum number of terms in the degree plan.
- `min_cpt::Int` : the minimum number of credits allowed in each term.
- `max_cpt::Int`: the minimum number of credits allowed in each term.
- `obj_order::Array{String, 1}` : the order in which the objective functions shoud be evaluated.  Allowable strings are:
  * `Balance` - the balanced curriculum objective described above.
  * `Prereq` - the requisite distnace objective described above.
  * `Toxicity` - the toxic course avoidance objective described above.
- `toxic_score_file::String`: file path to toxicity scores CSV
- `diff_max_cpt::Array{UInt, 1}` :  specify particular terms that may deviate from the `max_cpt` specified previously.
- `fix_courses::Dict(Int, Int)` : specify courses that should be assigned to particular terms in `(course_id, term)` 
    format.
- `consec_courses::Dict(Int, Int)`: specify pairs of courses that should appear in consecutive terms in `(course_id, course_id)` format.
- `term_range::Dict(Int, (Int, Int))` : specify courses that should in a particular range of terms in `(course_id, (low_range, high_range))` format.
- `prior_courses::Array{Term, 1}` : specify courses that were already completed in prior terms.
