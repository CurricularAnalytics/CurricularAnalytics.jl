# CurricularAnalytics.jl
**CurricularAnalytics.jl** is a toolbox for studying and analyzing academic program curricula.  The toolbox represents curricula as graphs, allowing various graph-theoretic measures to be applied in order to quantify the complexity of curricula. In addition to analyzing curricular complexity, the toolbox supports the ability to visualize curricula, to compare and contrast curricula, to create optimal degree plans for completing curricula that satisfy particular constraints, and to simulate the impact of various events on student progression through a curriculum. 

## Documentation
Full documentation is available at [GitHub Pages](https://curricularanalytics.github.io/CurricularAnalytics.jl/latest/).
Documentation for functions in this toolbox is also available via the Julia REPL help system.
Additional tutorials can be found at the [Curricular Analytics Notebooks](https://github.com/CurricularAnalytics/CA-Notebooks) site.

# Installation

Installation is straightforward.  First, install the Julia programming language on your computer.  To do this, download Julia here: https://julialang.org, and follow the instructions for your operating system.

Next, open the Julia application that you just installed. It should look similar to the image below. This interface is referred to as the `Julia REPL`.

![Julia termain](https://s3.amazonaws.com/curricularanalytics.jl/julia-command-line.png)

Next, enter Pkg mode from within Julia by hitting the `]` key, and then type:
```julia-repl
  pkg> add CurricularAnalytics
```
This will install the toolbox, along with the other Julia packages needed to run it. To load and use the toolbox, hit the `backspace` key to return to the Julia REPL. Now type:
```julia-repl
  julia> using CurricularAnalytics
```
The toolbox must be loaded again via `using CurricularAnalytics` every time you restart Julia.

For more information about installing the toolbox, including the steps neccessary to utilize degree plan optimization, please see the [INSTALLING.md](https://curricularanalytics.github.io/CurricularAnalytics.jl/latest/install.html)

## Supported Versions
* CurricularAnalytics master will be maintained/enhanced to work with the latest stable version of Julia.
* Julia 1.0 & 1.1: CurricularAnalytics v0.5.3 is the latest version guaranteed to work with Julia 1.0 and 1.1.
* Later versions: Some functionality might not work with prerelease / unstable / nightly versions of Julia. If you run into a problem, please file an issue.
